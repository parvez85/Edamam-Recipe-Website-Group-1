# Edamam-Recipe-Website-Group-1

## USER STORY:
As a health-conscious individual who loves to cook, I want to be able to easily search for recipes that not only taste great but also align with my nutritional needs.

I want a recipe website that I can search according to my dietary preferences and any allergies I have, and the recipes will be filtered accordingly.

Once I have found a recipe that I like, I can view the full ingredients list and step-by-step instructions, along with any necessary nutritional information, to ensure that I am cooking a healthy and delicious meal.

I would also like to be able to search the nutritional value of individual ingredients and have the results given back to me including calorie content and weight in grams.

I would like to stay up to date with relevant health and nutrition news from around the world that may impact my diet and the recipes I search for.


## Description

Happy Tummy is a recipe website that helps health-conscious individuals find healthy and delicious recipes that fit their dietary needs.

- The motivation for developing Happy Tummy came from our personal experience of struggling to find healthy and delicious recipes that fit individual dietary needs.

- We found that many recipe websites lacked the option to look up the nutritional values of ingredients and that searching through specific recipes could be time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to create a website that would solve these problems and help people like us find healthy and tasty recipes with ease. To solve these issues we used a recipe search API to offer a variety of recipe options to users.

- We were not able to find any recipe websites that had a nutritional search section which allowed users to search individual ingredients so we created a nutritional value search function on our website. We were able to find an API which allows users to retreive the nutritional value of individual ingredients.

- As health conscious individuals ourselves we found that it would be beneficial to stay informed about health and nutritional news from around the world as this has an impact on the types of recipes the user may search for. Therefore we added an API that calls a random health and nutrition news arcticle to our page which is randomised when the user refreshes the page to offer a selection of articles.

- Despite the challenges of working on this project remotely we were able to effectively communicate as a team via slack and supported each other when issues came up. We had to communicate frequently to ensure that we were all on the same page and working towards the same goals. We also learned the value of good code management practices and how it can help avoid conflicts and delays.

- Lastly, we gained a deeper understanding of web development technologies, specifically APIs and JavaScript. We learned how to use these languages to build a functional and visually appealing website, and how to integrate APIs to enhance the user experience.
